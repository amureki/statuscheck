Upon investigation, the Salesforce Technology team determined that the cause of the incident was related to an issue within the EU11 storage tier in the Paris data center that resulted in a sudden and unexpected exhaustion of capacity and led to the service disruption. In order to resolve the issue as quickly as possible, the team made the decision to site switch the EU11 instance from the Paris data center to the Frankfurt data center. That activity began at 07:45 UTC and was completed at 08:16 UTC. At that time, the service disruption was resolved and service levels returned to normal. \n\nThe Technology team has fixed the configuration issue in the storage tier in the Paris data center. Data written to the EU11 instance within the 15 minutes preceding the service disruption may not have been replicated to the redundant copy of the instance in our Frankfurt data center, and therefore may not have been present in that copy of EU11 when the site switch was performed. The team is currently investigating to determine if any transactions during this period were not present in the Frankfurt copy of EU11, and if so, the appropriate methods for restoring these transactions. As part of our standard process, we are performing a full root cause analysis and will provide our customers with a summary of the details upon request once they are available.\n\nWe appreciate your trust in us as we continue to make your success our top priority.","locale":"en"},{"id":2204,"modelName":"fieldOption","modelKey":"eMaint","modelAttribute":"label","text":"E-Maint","locale":"en"},{"id":2205,"modelName":"fieldOption","modelKey":"eMaint","modelAttribute":"value","text":"Salesforce will perform emergency maintenance on NA99 on on Tuesday, July 25, 2017, from 05:00 to 06:30 UTC (10:00 p.m. US Pacific to 11:30 p.m. US Pacific Monday, July 24, 2017).
